## 1. WHAT IS AN HSA? / HSA BASICS

### Definition & Core Concept

**Quote 1:**
"A Health Savings Account, or HSA, is just that—an account that you can contribute money to and use to pay for qualified out-of-pocket healthcare expenses."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 25

**Quote 2:**
"The government defines a Health Savings Account (HSA) as a 'tax-exempt trust or custodial account you set up with a qualified HSA trustee [for example, a bank, insurance company, or Treasury-approved non-bank custodian or trustee] to pay or reimburse certain medical expenses you incur.'"
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 25

**Quote 3:**
"A health savings account (HSA) is like a 401(k) for your health care costs. You and your employer can contribute money tax-free to your HSA, invest it and watch it grow tax-free, and then you can spend your tax-free money on qualified medical expenses."
- **Source:** HSAs For Dummies, Optum Financial Special Edition, Introduction, p. 1

**Quote 4:**
"A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged savings account for funds used to pay for healthcare expenses. Just like a 401(k), HSA participants own their accounts and have complete control over how the money is used to pay for eligible expenses—regardless of whether they change plans, retire, or leave your company."

## 2. TRIPLE TAX ADVANTAGE

### Tax Benefits Explained

**Quote 1:**
"Only a Health Savings Account (HSA) provides this 'triple-tax' benefit. At no point, from earning to spending (for qualified medical expenses), do the funds in your HSA incur either federal or most state income tax."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, Introduction, p. 5

**Quote 2:**
"An HSA provides potential triple-tax advantages because you pay no taxes on your contributions, earnings, or distributions—if you follow the rules."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 25

**Quote 3:**
"The triple-tax advantage includes: You pay no federal tax on contributions to your HSA—whether the contributions come from you, your employer, or from family and friends. As an added benefit, unlike a 401(k), you don't pay Social Security or Medicare taxes (e.g., FICA withholdings) on the money you and your employer contribute to your HSA through payroll."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, pp. 25-26

**Quote 4:**
"Your account and investment earnings are tax-free, if you use the money for qualified medical expenses. You pay no taxes on funds distributed from your HSA, provided you use the money for qualified medical expenses."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 26

**Quote 5:**
"An HSA can help employees save on taxes in three ways: 1) Annual HSA contributions are tax-advantaged; 2) Interest accrued on HSA balances is not taxable; and 3) Withdrawals for qualified out-of-pocket healthcare expenses are tax-free."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 15

**Quote 6:**
"Unlike 401(k)s, HSA contributions made pre-tax through payroll are not subject to Social Security (FICA) or Medicare taxes. HSA withdrawals are not subject to federal income tax as long as they are used for qualified medical expenses – no matter when a withdrawal occurs."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 15

### FICA Tax Savings

**Quote 1:**
"In 2025, FICA taxes include a 6.2% Social Security tax, a 1.45% Medicare tax, and a 1.45% Medicare surtax for those earning more than $200,000."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 26

**Quote 2:**
"For a worker in a 22% tax bracket, the effective savings on an HSA contribution made via payroll deduction can exceed 30%."

- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 6

**Quote 2:**
"A few other restrictions exist: You may not have other health coverage (except certain permitted coverage); You may not be enrolled in Medicare; No one can claim you as a dependent for tax purposes."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, pp. 6-7

---

## 4. CONTRIBUTION LIMITS & RULES

### Annual Limits

**Quote 1:**
"HSAs have contribution limits, which adjust each year based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Anyone can contribute to your HSA, with two caveats: the combined contributions from all sources must not exceed the annual limit, and only contributions from the account holder and the employer receive tax benefits."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 38

**Quote 2:**
"For 2016, these limits are: $3,350 per individual with self-only coverage; $6,750 for those with family coverage; $1,000 catch-up (55 years of age or older during the calendar year)."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 54

**Quote 3:**
"No matter who makes the contributions to your HSA, you must not exceed the annual maximum contribution limits. If you have more than one HSA, the total contributions for all of them must not exceed the max contribution limit."
- **Source:** HSAs For Dummies, Optum Financial Special Edition, p. 13

### Catch-Up Contributions

**Quote 1:**
"Individuals 55 and older can make catch-up contributions to their HSAs. HSA owners who turn 55 before the end of the tax year can make an additional $1,000 contribution that year (and every year thereafter) to increase their account balance before retirement."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 77

**Quote 2:**
"If each spouse is 55 or older, then both spouses can make a catch-up contribution, but must each have their own HSA for catch-up contribution deposits. A married couple with two individual HSAs may each make catch-up contributions of $1,000, totaling $2,000, if each person makes the catch-up contribution to their own account."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, pp. 77-78

### Mid-Year Enrollment & Full Contribution Rule

**Quote 1:**
"New account holders who enroll and are covered by an HSA-qualified health plan and open an HSA midyear may either contribute a prorated amount (for the actual number of months they qualify) or take advantage of the IRS full contribution rule and contribute the entire yearly maximum."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 78

**Quote 2:**
"The full-contribution rule (or last-month rule) allows individuals who have HSA-qualified health coverage on the first day of the last month of their tax year (December 1 for most taxpayers) to contribute up to their full yearly maximum."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 78

**Quote 3:**
"If you make the maximum contribution under the full-contribution rule, you must remain eligible until the last day of the next tax year (known as the testing period). If you lose eligibility during the testing period, you will pay income tax as well as a 10% excise tax on the overage."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 96

## 6. INVESTMENT & SAVING

### Investment Options

**Quote 1:**
"You can invest your HSA funds in the same sorts of investments approved for IRAs: annuities, certificates of deposit (CDs), stocks, mutual funds, and bonds.

- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 128

**Quote 2:**

- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, pp. 127-128

**Quote 3:**
"In addition to saving your HSA dollars, you can invest the money to help it grow, just like you do with a 401(k). Your investment portfolio may include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and certificates of deposit."

### Investment Threshold & Minimum Balance

### Power of Investing Example

**Quote 1:**
"If Raphael saves the same amount every year for 30 years but doesn't invest those dollars, he will accumulate $90,000 over a 30-year period, assuming he does not receive significant interest on his cash balance. However, if Raphael invests the net contribution of $3,000 each year in a diversified investment portfolio and achieves a 7% annualized rate of return, his savings could grow to about $306,000—this is, $216,000 more than the actual amount he invested."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 66

### Investment Strategies

**Quote 1:**
"HSA participants have different investment strategies. These strategies depend on their ages, life events, healthcare spending patterns, and overall risk tolerance and savings approach. Some participants want to actively manage their investments, while others want to take advantage of lifestyle or lifecycle funds that automatically adjust their risk profiles as participants age."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 64

**Quote 2:**
"Most HSAs provide a variety of investment options with different asset characteristics and risk profiles. Your HSA provider will provide online tools for managing your investments. It may even include asset allocation tools, target date funds, and the ability to automatically invest excess cash balances, or reallocate funds back to the cash account."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 64

### Investment Reality Check

**Quote 1:**
"Only 20% of employees primarily use their HSA to invest, though 44% say they want to invest more. There may be a lack of education and awareness around how to use an HSA as an investment tool."
- **Source:** HSA Bank Health and Wealth Index research document

**Quote 2:**
"Only 9% to 15% of HSA holders actually invest their funds in assets other than cash. This behavior is strongly correlated with age and income; older, higher-income account holders are significantly more likely to invest, while younger account holders maintain lower balances (averaging $1,154 for those under 25) and higher distribution rates."
- **Source:** Behavioral Architecture of Financial Avoidance research document

### Moving Money Between Investments

**Quote 1:**
"If you have a large qualified medical expense, you can move money out of your investments back into your HSA with no tax penalties and without affecting your yearly contribution maximum, because the IRS views this transfer as a dispersal, not a contribution."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, pp. 128-129

**Quote 2:**
"Some plans have no minimum requirement for starting an account. If you have a medical expense, you can move your investments back into your HSA without penalty."
- **Source:** HSAs For Dummies, Optum Financial Special Edition, p. 42

## 7. HSA vs OTHER RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS

### HSA vs 401(k)

**Quote 1:**
"Unlike the 401(k), neither you nor your employer pay FICA taxes (Social Security and Medicare) on HSA contributions made through payroll."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 29

**Quote 2:**
"If you contribute to an IRA or 401(k), you don't pay tax on your contributions, but you do pay taxes on the funds you withdraw during retirement (your original contributions plus account earnings). For a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), you pay tax on the money you contribute, but you don't pay tax on distributions (including account growth)."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, pp. 5-6

**Quote 3:**
"While it may seem simpler to have an HSA fund list that mirrors your 401(k), some 401(k) funds may not be best suited for the ever-changing spender/saver behavior of an HSA participant. After all, 401(k) plans are designed for participants to contribute funds and leave them there until after retirement."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 64

### HSA vs FSA

**Quote 1:**
"If you have a health Flexible Spending Account (FSA), you contribute and spend pretax dollars, but may lose funds you have not spent at the end of the plan year, unless your employer offers a limited carryover or grace period feature."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 6

**Quote 2:**
"Many young adults confuse the HSA with the Flexible Spending Account (FSA), leading to a 'use-it-or-lose-it' mentality that discourages long-term saving."
- **Source:** Behavioral Architecture of Financial Avoidance research document

### Superior Tax Treatment

**Quote 1:**
"Only HSAs provide the flexibility of a retirement savings plan but with a triple tax benefit: you make pre-tax contributions, your account grows and earns interest free of federal income tax (and free of income tax in most state taxes), and your distributions (when used for qualified medical expenses) also remain tax-free."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 6

---

## 8. FUNDING STRATEGIES

### Prioritizing Contributions

**Quote 1:**
"Determine if your employer contributes to either your HSA or other retirement accounts, the level of their contribution, and if you need to contribute to receive employer contributions. If possible, plan to contribute what you need to, to obtain the full employer contribution. Do not turn down free money."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 118

**Quote 2:**
"Consider first contributing enough money to your HSA and other retirement accounts to receive any contributions and matching funds that your employer offers. Then consider contributing to your HSA up to the allowable annual maximum contribution limit, including catch-up contributions if you qualify."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 118

**Quote 3:**
"Remember that an HSA provides tax-free reimbursement for any money that you spend on qualified medical expenses now or in the future. In addition, you can use an HSA after the age of 65 for non-healthcare spending without penalty—though you will pay income tax, as with traditional IRAs and other retirement accounts such as 401(k)s/403(b)s."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 118

### Paying Out of Pocket

**Quote 1:**

- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 49

---

## 9. PORTABILITY & OWNERSHIP

### You Own Your HSA

**Quote 1:**
"You own your HSA. This means HSA funds automatically roll over every year and the account becomes part of your estate upon death. Or the account can transfer to your spouse as an HSA."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 6

**Quote 2:**
"Because you own your HSA, you keep the savings when you spend less than you contribute in any given year."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 25

**Quote 3:**
"Your HSA is yours, just as your 401(k) is yours. After you start an HSA, it stays with you whether you change jobs, homes, or marital status."
- **Source:** HSAs For Dummies, Optum Financial Special Edition, p. 42

**Quote 4:**
"Funds deposited into your HSA remain in your account and automatically roll over from one year to the next. You may continue to use the HSA funds for qualified medical expenses. You are no longer eligible to contribute to an HSA for months that you are not an eligible individual because you are not covered by an HSA-qualified, high-deductible health plan."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 75

### No Use-It-Or-Lose-It

**Quote 1:**

### HSA After 65

**Quote 1:**

- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 75

**Quote 2:**
"Once you turn 65, you can also use your account to pay for things other than medical expenses. If used for other expenses, the amount withdrawn will be taxable as income but will not be subject to any other penalties."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 75

**Quote 3:**
"However, if you (or one of your tax dependents) is over 65, you may use HSA funds for non-qualified expenses without paying a penalty. Income taxes will still apply."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 101

### Medicare Enrollment

**Quote 1:**
"All contributions must cease once you enroll in Medicare. Though you can't contribute to your HSA, you can continue to invest the money in your account and take distributions for qualified medical expenses."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 78

**Quote 2:**
"If you delay your enrollment in Medicare, you can continue to make contributions (including catch-up contributions) past the age of 65, provided you still have an HSA-qualified health plan and no other disqualifying coverage."

## 13. HSA-QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS

---

## 14. YOUNG ADULTS & HSAs

### Knowledge Gaps

**Quote 1:**

- **Source:** Generational HSA Divide research document

**Quote 2:**
"Younger employees often view themselves as 'invincible' and thus perceive the HSA as an unnecessary complication. This perception is reinforced by traditional marketing that focuses on major surgeries or hospitalizations."
- **Source:** Generational HSA Divide research document

"The HSA-Compatible Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is a companion tax-advantaged account that allows participants to set aside pre-tax dollars specifically for qualified dental and vision expenses."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 39

**Quote 2:**
"FSAs and HRAs that limit expenses to dental and vision, typically referred to as limited purpose FSAs (LPFSAs) or limited purpose HRAs (LPHRAs), work in parallel with HSAs in that you can draw money from both accounts at the same time to pay for separate expenses."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 53

**Quote 3:**
"Employees can contribute an additional $2,550 (in 2016) to an HSA-Compatible FSA and use it to pay for dental, orthodontic, or vision expenses incurred by themselves or their dependents. This preserves HSA funds to pay for other qualified medical expenses."
- **Source:** WageWorks Guide to HSAs, p. 39

### Post-Deductible FSA/HRA

**Quote 1:**

- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 54

### Liquidity vs Literacy

**Quote 1:**
"Individuals who are liquidity-constrained (i.e., living paycheck-to-paycheck) are 20% less likely to contribute more than $3,000 to their HSA. For these individuals, the HSA is often used as a 'washing machine' for funds—depositing money only to immediately withdraw it to pay for current medical expenses, thereby missing out on the long-term investment benefits."

**Quote 2:**
"A lack of financial literacy leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of the HSA's versatility. 66% of HSA holders do not know how their funds are invested, and among those with low literacy, over 80% are unaware if their balance is held in cash or market assets."

### Employer Support Gap

**Quote 1:**
"Only 25% of employees said they strongly agree their employer provides education and resources to help enable them to invest their HSA funds."

## 17. DECISION-MAKING SUPPORT

### Cost Comparison

**Quote 1:**
"Choose an HSA provider that adds value by helping you research healthcare costs so you can save money and spend your healthcare dollars wisely."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 65

**Quote 2:**
"Most providers may have negotiated contracts with several health plans, so may not be able to tell you what your actual cost will be for the service. It's wise to contact your health plan about costs or how to obtain the best pricing when you visit your doctor."
- **Source:** HealthEquity HSA Guidebook, p. 127

### Seeking Discounts

**Quote 1:**
"If you take an expensive medication, you already know to check whether you can take a less expensive generic version. But if you have to stay with the more expensive option, checking with the drug manufacturer is a good idea. The drug maker may offer a discount or help with the cost."
