# Project aim and background

Project involves Track 4: Financial Health Planning Description: Many young adults struggle with financial planning, including saving, budgeting, and making informed decisions about spending or allocating income to important needs such as a Health Savings Account (HSA). While financial tools and information are widely available, they often lack personalized, supportive guidance that builds confidence and encourages long-term planning. This project explores the design of an AI-supported financial health planning tool that helps users reflect on financial goals, evaluate trade-offs, and make more intentional decisions. Students will design and prototype an interactive app or website that incorporates different advice sources and forms of guidance, allocation practices, peer support, and innovative features such. The project will include design testing and evaluation of features among student populations.

# Current goals

By tomorrow 2/16 I need to have a working prototype of the chatbot. The chatbot should involve providing basic facts about HSAs and potentially answering some pre-baked questions/answers or scenarios.
